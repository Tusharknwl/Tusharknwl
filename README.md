I'm currently a 4nd-year Electrical student at Delhi Technological University. I'm a Front-end Web Developer having good knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React JS. I have good knowledge of C++ as well and I have been doing competitive programming for the last 8 months on CodeChef ( 3star ) and Hackerrank.
Whenever I have free time, I love watching sci-fi movies, anime, and I love to listening music.
